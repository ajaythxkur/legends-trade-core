# 🔁 Legends Trade — Trustless Premarket & Points Market on Aptos

**Legends Trade** is a decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform built on **Aptos Move** that enables secure **premarket trading** and an upcoming **points marketplace** for early-stage token projects.  

It bridges the gap between **pre-TGE liquidity**, **off-chain points trading**, and **cross-chain user access**, all while staying fully **non-custodial** and trustless.

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Points Market (🚧 Coming Soon)
- Marketplace for project **points, loyalty credits, or pre-token units**.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Create an OTC Offer:**  
   User A lists a pre-TGE token or points offer with price, quantity, and expiration.

2. **Match & Accept:**  
   User B browses creates the order and accepts one. Assets are locked into a Move escrow.

3. **Secure Settlement:**  
   Once trade conditions are met, seller sends the tokens to the buyer.

4. **Cross-Chain Token Transfer (Future):**  
   Withdraw tokens to main chain through wormhole
